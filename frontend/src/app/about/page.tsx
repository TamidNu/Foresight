      Foresight is a revenue intelligence platform that helps hotels unlock their full revenue potential through AI-powered demand prediction. We solve a critical industry problem: hotels miss out on 10-20% of potential revenue due to mispriced rooms, costing a typical 150-room hotel between $600k-$1.3M annually.
      <br />
      <br /> Our AI system detects demand signals 10-14 days before customers book by analyzing events, weather patterns, flight data, and social media through advanced web scraping and machine learning algorithms. This allows revenue managers to make proactive pricing decisions rather than reactive adjustments throughout the day.
      <br />
      <br /> Founded by Sally Pigott and Juliette Nicault, two hospitality finance experts with deep industry experience, Foresight transforms the manual, guesswork-based pricing process into an intelligent, automated system. We don't just offer revenue management â€“ we provide revenue intelligence that helps hotels optimize pricing in real-time while maintaining human oversight and control.
      Stop reacting to demand. Start predicting it.
