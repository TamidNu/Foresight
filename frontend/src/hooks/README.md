# To research: 

- should we wrap the useUser hook from clerk to make it our own. 
- look into what services mean in programming 
- Fully understand RESTful APIs (what do they mean?)
- api should be in utils
- search how to make frontend architecture w/ user sevices, custom hooks, utils, components, etc.
- ask naman if you have any more questions.
