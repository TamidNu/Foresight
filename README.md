## ðŸŽ¯ This Semesterâ€™s Objectives

Weâ€™re aiming to deliver a solid foundation of Foresight this semester by completing **MVP 0** and beginning work on **MVP 1**. Hereâ€™s what we want to achieve by the end of the term:

- Enable Hotel Managers to **upload historical data** and generate trusted AI-driven pricing recommendations.
- Deliver a clean, intuitive user interface for viewing and exporting those recommendations.
- Validate recommendation quality via pilot testing with at least one hotel dataset.
- Lay the groundwork for PMS integration: test endpoints, data schemas, auth flow.
- Begin building dashboard/calendar UI and event/seasonality support.
- Establish reliable dev workflows: GitHub flow, CI/CD, formatting, documentation, testing.

4. **PMS Integration (Read-Only)** â€” ingest live reservation & availability data; sync status in UI.
5. **Code Quality & Dev Tools** â€” complete CI/CD setup, apply formatting and linting rules, expand tests.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team & Collaboration

- Everything goes through GitHub: issues, branches, PRs.
- Use the **TamidNu / Foresight GitHub project board** to track features & bugs.
- Pair up for reviews & cross-feature help.
- If youâ€™re new, pick up a **good-first-issue** to get familiar with the stack.
