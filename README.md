## ðŸŽ¯ This Semesterâ€™s Objectives

Weâ€™re aiming to deliver a solid foundation of Foresight this semester by completing **MVP 0** and beginning work on **MVP 1**. Hereâ€™s what we want to achieve by the end of the term:

- Enable Hotel Managers to **upload historical data** and generate trusted AI-driven pricing recommendations.
- Deliver a clean, intuitive user interface for viewing and exporting those recommendations.
- Validate recommendation quality via pilot testing with at least one hotel dataset.
- Lay the groundwork for PMS integration: test endpoints, data schemas, auth flow.
- Begin building dashboard/calendar UI and event/seasonality support.
- Establish reliable dev workflows: GitHub flow, CI/CD, formatting, documentation, testing.
