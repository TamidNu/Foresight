## 🎯 This Semester’s Objectives

We’re aiming to deliver a solid foundation of Foresight this semester by completing **MVP 0** and beginning work on **MVP 1**. Here’s what we want to achieve by the end of the term:

- Enable Hotel Managers to **upload historical data** and generate trusted AI-driven pricing recommendations.
- Deliver a clean, intuitive user interface for viewing and exporting those recommendations.
- Validate recommendation quality via pilot testing with at least one hotel dataset.
- Lay the groundwork for PMS integration: test endpoints, data schemas, auth flow.
- Begin building dashboard/calendar UI and event/seasonality support.
- Establish reliable dev workflows: GitHub flow, CI/CD, formatting, documentation, testing.

1. **Basline ML model** — Using the data available create a prediction model for pricing
2. **Data Scrape** — Scrape other travel sites to get more data on travel pricing and historical data to tune model
3. **Update Dashboard Skeleton** use the basic data analytics and integrate the analytics to the dashboard
4. **Dashboard & Calendar Views** — visual tools to see upcoming periods, pricing suggestions, flagged dates.
