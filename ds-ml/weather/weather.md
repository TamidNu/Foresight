# Weather + Holidays Pipeline

The purpose of this EDA is to determine whether weather and/or holidays have an effect on the total number of sales for Sally's hotel.

First we plotted temperature to see how it varies throughout the year in Ireland:

We chose to use 2023 because the inital hotel data only had the complete year of 2023. From the graphs, we can see that weather varies significantly, but follows a trend based on the seasons. In September, Dublin experience a large heat wave in the first 10 days of the month, which is reflected in the larger spike on the graph. Additionally, the temperature seems to vary more during the summer months compared to the winter months.

We also plotted precipitation to see how it varies throughout the year of 2023:

Precipitation has a much less clearer trend based on the seasons, with slight dips in precipitation around the winter months.

The precipitation varies significantly more than temperature does, even on a daily basis. 

Here's the total revenue the hotel made on each day of 2023:

It has a similar overall trend as the temperature graph with dips in the winter months.
