Hey guys, super excited to start working on this project with you guys. Just a couple of resources I want to highlight:

- cursor for students: [cursor for students](https://cursor.com/students)
- prettier (code formatter, makes life a lot easier): [Prettier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drtxWx1XojI)
- We will be working in a CI/CD pipeline. the github branches are important for that reason.

  - Main -> the branch that has push deployment, eventually once a ticket you are working on builds

- We are going to be working in a fast-paced dev environment, and I hope that you guys will learn from this a lot. I will keep adding to this document as resources for you guys
